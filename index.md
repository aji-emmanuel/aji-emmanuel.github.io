## Welcome to My Portfolio Site

My name is Emmanuel Ajibode, a fullstack developer from Nigeria. I'm proficient mainly in C#, .NET and ReactJS. I'm a curious learner and a creative team player, always seeking for opportunities where I can utilise my understanding of programming and software development to efficiently deliver sustainable economic growth that is profitable, environmentally responsible and socially relevant while having the scope to develop my own skills.

I built this portfolio site using ReactJs and some React Packages, Html and Css.
